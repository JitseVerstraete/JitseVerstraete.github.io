					<h2>Project Description</h2>
				</header>

				<p>
					Cloudy with a chance of cannonballs is local PvP game, in which you battle against your friends with
					airships! You ship has cannons on either side that can shoot different kinds of cannonballs in the
					direction of you opponents. Supply drops will float up above the clouds, giving you all kinds of
					power-ups like a speed boost, repairing your ship, changing your ammo type, faster fire rate. but
					sometimes the drop will be a bomb that will damage your ship! You might also encouter a special
					event such as a storm that sweeps your ship away or an armageddon that fills the arena with bombs.
				</p>

				<p>
					The game was made in Unity with a team of 6 students over the course of a semester. The game was
					voted by students to be 5th best out of a total of 28 submitted projects And we were invited to
					FLEGA cafe to show off our game.

					<h2>My Contributions</h2>
				</header>

				<p>
					I was one of two programmers assigned to this projects. The following features were the ones i was
					responsible for: <br>
					The movement (steering boosting) and shooting (aiming and firing) mechanics of the airships as well
					as linking these controls to the appropriate input actions using Unitys new input system.<br>
					The Different kinds of ammo types you can put in your cannons (normal shooting, shotgun spread,
					rapid fire minigun and a fast moving rocket)<br>
					The join screen logic and player management throughout the game as well as keeping track of player
					scores.<br>
					The functionality of some of the supply drops (ammo change, infinite boost, increased fire
					rate...)<br>
					Many other features, systems and bug fixes. Many features were worked on by both programmers but the
					ones listed above were my responsability.
