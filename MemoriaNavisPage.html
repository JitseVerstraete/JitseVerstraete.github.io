					<h3>Project Description</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					In this project, I was part of a team of 6 students tasked to make a game for our client, Roel
					Heremans. In one of his previous projects (The NeuroRight Arcades), he made arcade machines
					that sparked self-reflection in the user about the current and future state of neurotechnologies.
					These arcades use an EEG brain-computer-interface (called Enophones) that can read your brainwaves.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is where our project starts off. We were tasked to make a game using these enophones while
					keeping the self-reflective style of the NeuroRight Arcades.
					We ended up making Memoria Navis, a game where you take control of a spaceship that was originally
					controlled by a wiped human consiousness. Using the brain-computer-interface,
					you help the ship regaining its memories by inusing the ship with your thoughts and memories.
					There's more to the story but that is the basic outline.

					<h3>My Contributions</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					I was one of two programmers in the team responsible to create most of the functionality.
					<br />
					The main problem I had to solve was to create the system that reads the EEG-signal from the
					brain-computer-interface to be able to use it to influence the game. I used a library called
					"Brainflow" to read and process the signal read from the headset. This was very hard at first as i
					had never worked with this kind of technology before.
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the biggest systems i made was the "meditation orb". At a certain point int the game,
					you will have to meditate in order to merge your memories with this orb. When you are meditating,
					the game will read the eeg signal coming from your brain and use that to influence the parameters of
					the orb. So depending on what electromagnetic signals your brain was sending out during your
					meditation, the orb would change color, size, turbulunce, cohesion...
				</p>

				<p>
					I also made some gameplay mechanics like:
					<br />
					The movement of the spaceship, making sure it feels good and somewhat realistic. We wanted to make
					the game as accesible as possible so the ship is controlled with only the mouse.
					<br />
					The ai movement behavior of the "sparks" (an entity in the game you have to chase and catch). I
					used a blended steering script to determine the desired movement direction. This was a combination
					of wandering around, chasing/fleeing from the player and some random input.
					<br />
					Some systems to spawn/despawn asteroids (or other debris) around the player to create the illusion
					of flying through a never ending asteroid field.
					<br />
					...
